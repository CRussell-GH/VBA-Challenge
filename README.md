# VBA-Challenge
VBA Homework #2


This VBA script in Stocks.vba does calculations on the file resources/Multiple_year_stock_data.xlsx.

It will create a summary table that includes stock names, total volume, yearly change and percent change.  (Positive percentages will be shown in green and negative in red.)  It will then calculate the greatest percentage increase, decrease and total volume.  It will output those in a table with their corresponding stock names.

The script will run for every sheet in the workbook.

Please see 2014 Stocks.png, 2015 Stocks.png, and 2016 Stocks.png for outputs.


NOTE:  This script can be run on other workbooks, Provided the following:

A header row is included.
Columns from left to right are "Ticker, Date, Open, High, Low, Close, Volume"
Data must be sorted by date first and then alphabetical for Ticker column last.
